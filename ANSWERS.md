## UI Tasks

1. Improve the layout of the Login screen. The previous dev didn't apply any styles!

 ***⇒ Used bootstrap for this, and also for most of other css and html changes that i have made as i am more familiar with that .***

2. Improve the layout of the Contacts screen. Currently, it only has what we can call some **basic** styling!
3. The Navbar today is static, thus not really mobile-friendly. Make it mobile-friendly!

 ***⇒ Used a very simple bootstrap hack to achieve this - can be done different on a complex project. But nonetheless gets the job done .***

4. Make the Profile forms stacked.
5. The "Send Message" functionality is relying on some old-school prompts. Please provide a more modern solution.

 ***⇒ Used bootstrap modal  .***

## Full-stack tasks

1. The Profile page is not calling the backend. What a gap in implementation. Please fix it!

 ***⇒ Also added pre populating of the name and email when you go the the profile page as well .***

2. The History page should show the logged-in user's message history. Please implement it as you see fit.

## System Design

1. What do you think of the app in general?

 ***⇒ The overall structure is good, especially how the containers have been put together is impressive .I will surely borrow a leaf from your setup. But i was wondering if the angular cli could also be installed in a container and not necessarily on my machine. As you will notice am not an angular person, i haven't touched the framework since its infancy and even then it was only for brief a period so i don't know how feasible that can be done but i am for it. Otherwise the structure is just fine***

2. What things struck you from the code that you believe could be improved?

***⇒ A lot i would say and i just made multiple improvements already. To be more specific the backend could have had a generic controller to take up some reusable code (like CRUD functionality) and have it in one place. This is my way of working. And also we could have unit tests to keep the application stable over time. I believe the angular side can also use some generic service to take up repetitive code. Am coming from backend heavy background so i would speak more confidently on the api side***

3. What design (HTML, CSS) changes should be done to make it better to use and to code? Did you make any of them along the way on the tasks?

***⇒ I guess here i would mention the bootstrap package that i added or tailwind or material UI (which most angular developers like) to assist with some common interface challenges and code timely and productively. I added bootstrap which am familiar with***

## About the test

We know tech tests are hard to get right, to measure your skills and not be cumbersome. Thus, we are always looking to improve our processes. The next questions are not to evaluate you; they are just to help us improve.

1. What were your thoughts about the test?

***⇒ I think this test mostly focused on the frontend side than the backend. I am  backend heavy developer so i really didn't show case most of my skills. Nonetheless i have enjoyed the test , i love problem-solving so i was mostly trying to understand the angular side and make changes to it. As i already mentioned i haven't touched angular for years(though willing to learn more) so i really had to google around, reverse engineer some things and reuse some of you own code to get things done***

2. How could we improve it?

***⇒ On improvements do this , remove this project from the test gorilla questions. Instead just pick some 30 mins to 1 hr coding challenge(most likely php coding challenge) from test gorilla and add it as the last question. You can use the test gorilla as the first screening point, candidates that have passed the test gorilla should then be send this project as an email and given 1 or 2 days to complete and submit the zipped project. Make it a two step process***


3. Was it easy to get hands-on with the tasks? (environment setup and all of that)

***⇒ Yes am familiar with docker so the setup wasn't a hustle at all***
